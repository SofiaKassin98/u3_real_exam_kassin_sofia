For the u3_real_exam_kassin_sofia  (war machine robot).


The distance sensor is continuously rotating around the post looking for an enemy.
When the distance sensor detects an enemy, the robot should stop and the gun should point to the enemy.
 
2^(8)-1 = 255

Look up table and the resolution with 1


Once the gun is pointing to the enemy, it should start to shoot (print and log ”THA TAH THA TAAAAH!!!!”). The more near the enemy, the more emphasis on the shooting (at least 3 different levels).
Gun distance sensor has 10 bit resolution, with a min range of 10cm and max range of 2m. Mobile distance sensors have 8 bit resolution, with a min range of 5cm and max range of 40 cm.

2^(10)-1 = 1023

You will need to create two objects for testing, one object simulating an enemy and one object simulating an obstacle.
The Webots world should be saved in such a way all requirements can be showed by just starting the simulation.
